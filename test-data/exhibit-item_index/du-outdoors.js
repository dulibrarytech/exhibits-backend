The University of Denver resides on lands that are held in stewardship by the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. With much gratitude, we recognize the descendant communities of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe of Montana, the Northern Arapahoe Tribe of Wyoming, and the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. Through their sacrifices, we can engage in learning and collaboration to further the study of higher education. We also acknowledge that John Evans, the founder of the University of Denver, has been found culpable for the events of the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&apos;text-align: center&apos;&gt;&lt;button style=&apos;background: #F1A35E; border: none; border-radius: 18px; padding: 0.4em 1.2em; color: white; font-weight: bold;&apos;&gt;John Evans Report&lt;/button&gt;&lt;button style=&apos;background: #F1A35E; border: none; border-radius: 18px; padding: 0.4em 1.2em; color: white; font-weight: bold; margin-left: 15px&apos;&gt;Decolonize DU&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;",

One hundred first-year students led by counselors of upperclassmen spent the weekend getting to know each other. This tradition continued, changing in name and location over time. The outing moved to Geneva Glenn in 1976 and was renamed “Pioneers in the Rockies.” Following the establishment of the University of Denver John C. Kennedy Mountain Campus in 2022, this experience became known as “First Ascent.” The university’s outdoor first-year student orientation was designed to be an enlightening and fulfilling trip for new students. Many participants reflect positively on the opportunity to explore the mountains for the first time and to find a reprieve from distressing concerns of the era. Team building activities, games, and campfires have been a hallmark of the experience since its origin.",

It has been held in various locations west of Denver such as Winter Park, Steamboat Springs, and Crested Butte. The carnival began as a three-day event. However, it was extended to a full week of festivities in 1962. Since its origin, participants have enjoyed skiing, dancing, drinking, and competing with fellow University of Denver community members. The Winter Carnival usually involves on-campus events, such as a chili cook-off, followed by weekend events on the mountain.",

Between 1950 and 1970, visitation to National Park Service lands increased from 33 million to 172 million people annually. This growth is attributed to greater federal investment in recreational infrastructure and an increase of leisure time for the average American. Activities such as hiking and sailing captivated DU students as early as the 1890s. A few decades later, in 1928, skiing was introduced as a new winter sport on the DU campus. Other activities, such as rafting, kayaking, and climbing, did not take hold on campus until the 1970s. Nonetheless, each of these activities has a well-tread legacy at the University of Denver of at least 50 years. Today, various campus organizations support the continuation of this legacy. Some of the photos in this section have been generously provided by officers of the following organizations: DU Alpine Club, DU Club Climbing, DU Club Kayaking, DU Backpacking Club, Outdoor Leadership Program, DU Ski Team.",

In the 1950s, climbers such as Royal Robbins and Warren Harding ascended Half Dome and El Capitan, two of Yosemite National Parks’ major peaks. The 1960s and 70s saw advancements in equipment that reduced damage to the rock. It was not until the mid-1980s to early 1990s that climbing&apos;s popularity grew rapidly. This resulted in debates regarding style and ethics as well as the management of climbing activities on public land. Since the 1980s, Indigenous groups have raised opposition to climbing practices that cause damage to sites of cultural and spiritual significance. As a result, some climbs have been closed, such as at Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park in Australia. Officially established in Fall 2013, DU’s Club Climbing welcomes participants of all skill levels.",

Entry into certain activities can be more challenging than others, but everyone starts as a beginner. Many of the outdoor clubs on campus welcome participants of all skill levels. When exploring with others or alone, think about how you would like to recreate responsibly. Recognize the privilege that comes with feeling safe and welcome in the outdoors. Consider how you might contribute to cultivating that experience for all individuals seeking to connect with nature. Respect the connections others may hold to place and the life that calls it home.&lt;/div&gt;",
