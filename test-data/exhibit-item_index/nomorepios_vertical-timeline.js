            "<p>The state of Colorado saw one of the most brutal examples of settler colonialism in the Sand Creek Massacre, which took place in November 1864, just months after the University of Denver was founded. Colorado’s Third Cavalry, led by Colonel John Chivington (also a member of the DU Board of Trustees and early donor to DU), committed the massacre, killing hundreds of mostly Cheyenne and Arapaho women, children, and elders. John Evans, the founder of the University of Denver and then-Territorial Governor, was found by the John Evans Study Committee to have been culpable for the massacre given his aggressively anti-Native rhetoric and actions leading up to the massacre. </p>",

A committee of faculty and staff from DU and other institutions was created to inquire into the nature of John Evans’ involvement in the Sand Creek Massacre. The University of Denver \"John Evans Study Committee Report\" was produced, and the study found John Evans culpable in the Sand Creek Massacre. This report and some of the recommendations from the Native American Inclusivity Task Force (2016) helped implement some modest structural change, but these changes have proven to be inconsistent and incomplete. The Native Student Alliance (NSA) has been the primary force behind the most recent demands to remove both the “Boone” character and the “Pioneer” moniker, as both are legacies of the U.S. and DU’s history with settler colonialism. </p>"+

      "text": "The #NotYourMascots campaign started in 2014 on social media by journalist Jacqueline Keeler (Diné and Yankton Sioux). She explains that the mission of the campaign is to \"combat the public misappropriation of Native American imagery, and [call] out entities complacent with, as well as ones directly profiting from, blatant racism.\" Though #NoMorePios aims to address the \"Pioneer\" moniker and the associated mascots rather than the appropriative imagery of Native peoples, the two have similar goals. This image and the rest of the exhibit show that the \"Pioneer\" nickname, used since 1925, has been associated with the glorification of settler colonialism and related cultural appropriation of images of Native peoples. Other schools in the American West with similar mascot and nickname histories have changed their mascots in response to student protest and engagement. In 2016, the student newspaper of Whitman College (founded 1859) in Walla Walla, Washington changed their name from \"The Pioneer” to \"The Whitman Wire.” The editors wrote, \"At the time the paper was founded, the college was in the midst of reinforcing a telling of history that celebrated the arrival of white invaders–pioneers–to the Columbia Plateau. According to this story of the pioneers, they arrived in an empty and savage land. In reality, they were coming into the homelands of the Cayuse, Walla Walla, Umatilla and other peoples who have inhabited this land for as long as any can remember.” (Johnson, Cornett, and Clay, 2016). The California State University campus at Long Beach removed a statue of \"Prospector Pete” from the courtyard (Del Real, 2018). Another campus of California State University at East Bay removed Pioneer Pete as their mascot in 2018. The University has, however, retained the \"pioneer” moniker (Diaz, 2018).",

      "text": "Mascots that uphold and reinforce settler colonial stereotypes can have negative psychological ramifications for Native youth. Stephanie Fryberg (Tulalip), writing with several co-authors (2010) found that after viewing mascots and \"romantic” movies like Pocahontas, Native youth had lower self-esteem and sense of community worth (2010). Davis-Delano, Gone, and Fryberg (2020) explored the psychosocial effects of mascots on Native youth through a comprehensive review. They found that Native American mascots, regardless of the stated intent to \"honor” Native Americans, \"induce or correlate with negative psychosocial outcomes.” There was no evidence from any study that Native American mascots foster positive or beneficial psychosocial effects for Native Americans.” (Davis-Delano et al., 2020). The use of mascots and other romanticized views of Native Americans and the American West maintain the harmful stereotype that Native Americans are part of the historicized past, rather than contemporary people who are part of sovereign nations that continue to survive and resist. As the University re-engages the Native American Community Advisory board and continues down the path of reconciliation with the Northern Cheyenne, Northern Arapaho and Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Nations, it is important that senior leadership reckon honestly and transparently with the impacts of our decisions about messaging and representation in regards to the mascot and Pioneer nickname.",
